Automated Image Enhancement and Segmentation for Detecting Boundaries of Palynological Material


The acquisition of high quality palynological images for palynofacies analysis is a laborious process that requires a large amount of manual processing, as well as subjective manual tracing of object 
boundaries. With the exception of some recently developed and highly specialised software packages, the typical approach is to import the image into a software package such as CoralDraw /Illustrator
and manually trace the boundary to remove defects. Elimination of noise and unwanted backgrounds, as well as making selective adjustments such as colour balance is a time consuming process. Here
we present a relatively simple package of programmes within a Mathematica environment that allows quick and accurate automated determination of object boundaries, as well as a fast automated image
enhancement solution. Additionally within this suit the option to quickly rotate images or carry out stacking within the same package increases productivity. The results have been compared to manual
traces of images for eight palynological particles, yielding a fast and effective approach for final image acquisition. Our automated process eliminates the subjectivity of manual analysis, removes
variation between different observers, reliably replaces the need for manually tracing particle boundaries as well as increasing sharpness and produces publication quality images of palynological material.
